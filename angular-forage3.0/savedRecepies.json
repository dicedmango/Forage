[{"name":"Salmon en croute","description":"","subtitle":"WITH BROCCOLI, ZINGY BULGUR & SPICY BEANS","ingredients":"olive oil, 2 banana shallots, 100 g baby spinach, 1 bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, 200 g baby leaf watercress, 1 knob of butter, 1-2 lemons, 1 whole nutmeg , for grating, 200 g crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, 1 x 500 g thick, skinless salmon fillet, pin-boned, from sustainable sources, 500 g puff pastry, 1 large free-range egg","Method":"Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC/400ÂºF/gas 6. Line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper and brush it with a little oil. Peel and finely chop the shallots, roughly chop the spinach, then pick and chop the parsley leaves. Chop half the watercress, leaving the rest whole. To make the filling, warm the butter and a splash of oil in a pan over a low heat. Add the shallots and cook for 10 minutes, or until soft but not coloured. Add the spinach, parsley and chopped watercress to the pan with the zest and juice from 1 lemon. Season to taste and stir in a good grating of nutmeg. Cook down the leaves for 3 to 5 minutes, then mix in 1 tablespoon of the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. Tip it into a sieve set over a bowl and press to squeeze out the juices. Leave the filling to cool. To make the sauce, blitz the remaining watercress and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che in a food processor with juices from the bowl. Season and add more lemon juice to taste. Transfer to a bowl and chill until needed. Slice the salmon fillet in half sideways, so you can open it like a book. Spoon the cooled filling down the middle, fold the fish back over to close and set aside. Cut the pastry in half and roll out each piece to the thickness of a pound coin and about 2cm wider than your salmon. Place one piece on the baking tray and lay the salmon on top in the middle. With your finger, dab water around the edge of the pastry, then lay the other piece on top. Mould the pastry around the fish with your hands, then press the edges with a fork to seal. Score the top with a knife, then beat and brush over the egg. Bake the salmon in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp. Serve with the watercress sauce â€“ delicious with a green salad and new potatoes.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/430_575/1QQhh_bsanv9hpOL0HSSyo.jpg","id":0},{"name":"Salmon with rhubarb sauce & tarragon mayo","description":"This simple, delicate poached salmon is served with some beautifully bold accoutrements, from a tangy rhubarb sauce to a zingy tarragon mayonnaise.

Add the red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt, scrunch together, then set aside to allow the onions to turn pink. Meanwhile, make the rhubarb sauce. Trim the rhubarb, peel and core the apple, then chop both into 2cm pieces. Place the fruit in a pan with the honey, bay leaf and whole cloves. Add a splash of vinegar and the orange juice. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium. Cover and leave to cook for about 30 minutes, or until the rhubarb has softened. Add a little extra honey to sweeten, if necessary.

Add the rest of the oil and blitz again, then strain through a piece of muslin into a jug. Place the egg yolks in a mixing bowl with the mustard and whisk well. Very slowly drip the tarragon oil into the egg yolk as you whisk; when youâ€™ve added half of the oil, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar, then continue whisking in the oil (you might not need all of it). Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Carefully remove the salmon to a serving board and gently remove the skin. Break up the salmon flesh into lobes and arrange on a large platter, then rub them with a little oil. Pick the herb leaves over the onions and toss well. Serve the poached salmon with the pickled onions, some lovely boiled new potatoes and the rhubarb sauce and tarragon mayo on the side.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/430_575/95N2GNVp4Cy9RMPsG_0LGh.jpg","id":1},{"name":"Grilled pork chops","description":"","subtitle":"WITH BROCCOLI, ZINGY BULGUR & SPICY BEANS","ingredients":"300g bulgur wheat, 2 lemons, 4 thick boneless higher-welfare pork chops, olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 fresh red chillies, 2 400g can cannellini beans, 400g tenderstem broccoli, extra virgin olive oil","Method":"Place a griddle pan over a high heat, and switch the oven to the lowest setting.

The way I heard it, this brilliant rub was invented by an African-American chef working at Commanderâ€™s Palace, a posh New Orleans restaurant. The famous head chef there, Paul Prudhomme, took this recipe, added his own little tweaks and introduced blackened fish to the rest of the world. Basically itâ€™s a bold rub that fragrantly flavours fish and meat and goes dark when it cooks, thanks to the paprika and garlic., Traditionally this dish has been made with the locally caught redfish, but itâ€™s also great with any whole or filleted white fish. It goes with so many things, including chicken, pork, lamb and steak. When I was in Louisiana I cooked it on a barbecue, but Iâ€™ve shown you below how to do it indoors in a pan. Donâ€™t be scared by how black the spices go: theyâ€™ll look burnt but the taste will be amazing., To make the rub, bash up your fresh herbs and garlic in a pestle and mortar until you've got a nice coarse paste. Mix in the spices, salt, pepper and olive oil, then squeeze in the juice of half the lemon, making sure not to let any pips get in there, and stir well., Lightly score the skin of your fish in lines about 2cm apart. Using your fingers, smear the rub all over both sides of the fish and into the cuts you've made. Put a non-stick pan or griddle pan over a medium-high heat and let it get nice and hot. Place your fish in the pan, skin side down, and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. It will get quite smoky, so you might want to open a window! Turn the heat down to low, then, very carefully, flip your fish over and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side., Cut your remaining lemon half and your second lemon into wedges for squeezing over. Serve them with your fish, a nice salad and boiled or steamed new potatoes dressed in good olive oil or butter.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic and coriander stalks and fry for 1 minute. Drain, rinse and add the beans, then fry for a further few minutes. Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, or until crisp and piping hot through, stirring occasionally. Finely grate in the lime zest, roughly chop and add half the coriander leaves. Stir well and remove from the heat. Roughly chop the tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring onions, then add to a bowl with the juice of the lime. Roughly chop and add the remaining coriander leaves, mix well and season to taste. Shred the lettuce and cooled chicken.

Iâ€™ve finished the chicken in the oven, purely because you really do need a big fryer to do it properly, as well as for good temperature control, and this method is much friendlier for home cooking. To make the brine, toast the peppercorns in a large pan on a high heat for 1 minute, then add the rest of the brine ingredients and 400ml of cold water. Bring to the boil, then leave to cool, topping up with another 400ml of cold water. Meanwhile, slash the chicken thighs a few times as deep as the bone, keeping the skin on for maximum flavour. Once the brine is cool, add all the chicken pieces, cover with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for at least 12 hours â€“ I do this overnight. After brining, remove the chicken to a bowl, discarding the brine, then pour over the buttermilk, cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge for a further 8 hours, so the chicken is super-tender. When youâ€™re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 190Â°C/375Â°F/gas 5. Wash the sweet potatoes well, roll them in a little sea salt, place on a tray and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the pickle â€“ toast the fennel seeds in a large pan for 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Pour in the vinegar, add the sugar and a good pinch of sea salt, then finely slice and add the cabbage. Place in the fridge, remembering to stir every now and then while you cook your chicken. In a large bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder, cayenne, paprika and the onion and garlic powders. Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with oil â€“ the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full â€“ and place on a medium to high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when itâ€™s ready (180Â°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden â€“ thatâ€™s a sign itâ€™s ready to go. Take the chicken out of the fridge, then, one or two pieces at a time, remove from the buttermilk and dunk into the bowl of flour until well coated. Give them a shake, then place on a large board and repeat with the remaining chicken pieces. Turn the oven down to 170Â°C/325Â°F/gas 3 and move the sweet potatoes to the bottom shelf. Once the oil is hot enough, start with 2 thighs â€“ quickly dunk them back into the flour, then carefully lower into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry for 5 minutes, turning halfway, then remove to a wire rack over a baking tray. Bring the temperature of the oil back up, repeat the process with the remaining 2 thighs, then pop the tray into the oven. Fry the 4 drumsticks in one batch, then add them to the rack of thighs in the oven for 30 minutes, or until all the chicken is cooked through. Serve with your baked sweet potatoes, cabbage pickle and some salad leaves.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/oldImages/430_575/1356_1_1440772046.jpg","id":16},{"name":"Beef tacos","description":"â€œThis spicy chargrilled chicken packs a punch â€“ the longer you leave it to marinate, the more intense the flavour.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large casserole pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the rosemary and bacon and fry for 2 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp up, stirring regularly. Add all the minced meat, using a wooden spoon to break it up as you go. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for at least 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. Place the coarse grater attachment in your food processor (or you could use a box grater instead) and grate the Cheddar, then tip into a bowl. Replace the grater with the regular blade. Trim and halve the carrots, then add to the processor and blitz to roughly the same size as the mince. Peel and halve the onions, add them to the carrot and blitz again. Tip into the pan with the mince while you get on with blitzing and adding the celery. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften, stirring regularly. Next, add the tomato purÃ©e and plum tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Fill each of the tins with water and tip into the pan. Give everything a good stir and reduce the heat to low. Leave to simmer around 2 hours, or until thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally. While that ticks away, make your white sauce. Trim, wash and finely slice the leeks, then add to a pan along with 2 tablespoons of oil and the bay leaves. Stir well and season with a tiny pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 30 minutes, or until sweet and softened, adding splashes of water, if needed. Add the flour and stir well to coat, then gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Turn the heat up to medium, bring to the boil, then reduce to low and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened, stirring regularly. Carefully transfer the sauce to the food processor and blitz until smooth and silky. Add half the grated cheese and finely grate over half the nutmeg and mix well. Season to taste. Once the ragÃ¹ is ready, preheat the oven to 190ÂºC/375ÂºF/gas 5. Season the ragÃ¹ to taste, then transfer half into freezer bags, portioning up as appropriate for your family. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pop in the freezer for another day. Itâ€™s a good idea to freeze them flat so that you can reheat them quickly and easily. Itâ€™s also a good idea to label and date them to avoid a game of freezer roulette in a few weeks' time! To build your lasagne, spoon a quarter of the ragÃ¹ into a large deep ovenproof dish (roughly 25cm by 30cm) and spread it out evenly. Spoon over a quarter of the white sauce, then snap over some lasagne sheets, making sure they completely cover the sauce in one layer. Repeat this 3 times, finishing with a layer of white sauce. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and bake the lasagne in the oven for 45 minutes or until golden and bubbling. Remove the lasagne from the oven and leave to sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Delicious served with a fresh green salad.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/oldImages/430_575/1475_6_1432138866.jpg","id":18},{"name":"Spaghetti Bolognese","description":"","subtitle":"","ingredients":"2 cloves of garlic, 1 onion, 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, 6 rashers dry-cured higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon, olive oil, 500 g minced beef, 200 ml red wine, 1 x 280 g jar of sun-dried tomatoes, 2 x 400 g tins of plum tomatoes, 500 g dried spaghetti, Parmesan cheese, extra virgin olive oil","Method":"Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC/350ÂºF/gas 4.

But there is a particular sequence of events that needs to happen in order to achieve the most ridiculously tasty, chomp-worthy sandwich. Follow this recipe, and it will always make you feel good. It is also especially useful when youâ€™re suffering from a light hangover. This is when the condiments â€“ dolloped onto a side plate like a painterâ€™s palette â€“ really come into their own. With the No. 1 toasted cheese sarnie we donâ€™t score any points for buying expensive, artisan bread. Itâ€™s important to go for something neutral, and in my eyes, only a white bloomer will do. Lightly butter the bread on both sides (oh, and if youâ€™ve got any leftover mashed potato, spread that across one piece of the bread â€“ itâ€™s insanely good). To one piece of bread, add a nice grating of good-quality cheese that melts well, like Cheddar, Red Leicester or a mixture of the two. Place your second piece of bread on top, then cook in a sturdy non-stick frying pan on a medium heat for about 3 minutes on each side. This is important, because if it gets too coloured too quickly you wonâ€™t get the gorgeous ooze and melt in the middle, and this is all about encouraging that internal cheese lava flow. As it cooks, I like to rest something flat with a little weight on top to ensure maximum surface area and crunch. When lightly golden on both sides, lift the toastie out of the pan and grate a little layer of cheese into the pan where it was sitting. Place the toastie back on top and grate some more cheese on the top side. Leave it for just over 1 minute â€“ wait for the cheese to bubble and the fat to spill out of it, then add a little pinch of cayenne pepper. Give the toastie a poke with a fish slice, and once it has a cheesy, doily-like crust on the bottom that moves as one, lift the toastie out of the pan and hold it on the fish slice for 30 seconds so the melted cheese hangs down, sets hard and forms an impressive cheese crown. Flip it onto the other side and once golden, serve, remembering to let it cool for a couple of minutes before attempting to tuck in. The final debate is what do you want on the side? Tomato ketchup, brown sauce, a shake of Tabasco or hot sauce, mango chutney or a mixture? All are fine choices.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/oldImages/430_575/1297_1_1436868428.jpg","id":37},{"name":"Pork & apple sausage rolls","description":"â€œThis spicy chargrilled chicken packs a punch â€“ the longer you leave it to marinate, the more intense the flavour.

I hadnâ€™t realized Italian immigrants had cleverly adapted their old-world recipes to suit new-world coalfired ovens. Making pizzas in tins to protect the base from the soot of the oven makes perfect sense to me now, and I can honestly say that when itâ€™s cooked and seasoned with proper love and care, Iâ€™m more than happy with this representative of the pizza family. To make your dough, pour your lukewarm water into a large bowl and use a fork to stir in the yeast, sugar and salt. Add your flour, bit by bit, until it comes together. You want smooth springy dough, so keep adding a bit more flour if necessary. Dust a clean surface with flour, then knead the dough with your hands. When youâ€™re happy with the consistency, pop it into a flour-dusted bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm room until the dough has almost doubled in size. Meanwhile, put a lug of olive oil into a large pan on a medium heat. Add your sliced onions and thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and golden. Take the pan off the heat and put aside. Put all the tomato sauce ingredients into a food processor or liquidizer with a good pinch of salt and pepper and blitz to a purÃ©e. Have a taste and season carefully, adding a bit more salt and pepper if it needs it. Slit the sausages open and squeeze the meat into a bowl. Bash up the dried chilli and fennel seeds in a pestle and mortar, add these to the meat with the dried oregano and mix well with a fork. Preheat your oven to 200ÂºC/400ÂºF/gas 6. Divide the dough in half and oil 2 trays (about 25 x 35cm) with olive oil. Use a rolling pin or clean hands to flatten and stretch the dough out. Roll or push the dough around each tray and really push it into the corners so you get a chubby crust and a base about 1cm thick. Divide your blitzed tomato sauce between the pizzas and spread around. Scatter over the caramelized onions and dot small pinches of the sausage mixture around the top of each pizza. Tear up the mozzarella and dot the pieces over the sausage, then sprinkle over the fresh basil leaves, sliced fresh chilli, a good pinch of salt and pepper and the grated Parmesan. Finally let your slices of pancetta sort of fall on to the pizzas so they curl and crisp up as they cook. Place in the bottom of the oven for about 20 minutes so the base gets nice and crispy while the top is cooking. Once your pizzas are beautifully cooked, serve right away with a fresh green lemony salad.","user":"jamie_oliver","img":"http://cdn.jamieoliver.com/recipe-database/oldImages/430_575/970_1_1439299335.jpg","id":45},{"name":"Arrosto misto","description":"","subtitle":"","ingredients":"1 bulb of garlic, Â½ a bunch of fresh thyme, olive oil, 1 x 1.8 kg free-range chicken, 1 lemon, 1 x 2 kg duck, 1 stick of cinnamon, Â½ a bunch of fresh sage, 4 bulbs of fennel, 6 red onions, 8 sturdy sprigs of fresh rosemary, 2 pigeons, 2 partridges, 2 quails, 500 g quality sausages in one string, 1 handful of fresh bay leaves, 1 tablespoon plain flour, 150 ml chianti, 1 x 400 g tin of plum tomatoes, 300 ml organic chicken stock, GREMOLATA, Â½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 lemon, POLENTA, 250 g polenta, 100 g unsalted butter, 150 g Parmesan cheese","Method":"Preheat the oven to full whack.

Season the pigeons, partridges and quails all over with salt and pepper and drizzle with the rosemary oil. Gently untwist the links between the sausages and push the meat along to make one long sausage. Start by curling one end in, then twirl the sausage round itself in a spiral until you have one big circle of sausage. Place a few bay leaves in between the spirals. Sharpen the ends of the rosemary sprigs, then use them to skewer and secure the sausages in place. Drizzle with oil. Once cooked, remove the chicken to a plate, cover with tin foil and a clean tea towel, then leave to rest. Place the small birds directly on the oven shelf next to the duck.
