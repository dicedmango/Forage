<h7 id="left">On our first day back to university we were briefed on “A System For Living” and were assigned into teams of five to build momentum for projects, which later we would take on by ourselves. A strong focus of the brief is to look at combatting environmental issues in modern life. While brain storming our team came up with multiple ideas around the theme of waste. How to prevent it, reduce it or make profit from it. For example in the UK the average person generates 4.3 pounds of waste per day. This is 1.6 pounds more then most people produced in 1960. Approximately 55% of the 220 million tons of waste generated each year ends up in landfill. <br><br>

Your average landfill produces 2,000 litres of methane a day. That is the equivalent to what the ¼ of the population of the worlds of cars produce daily. This methane is wasted energy being polluted into our climate. This amount of gas could fuel every car in Belgium for 2 weeks. For this project my team are looking to see if there is any possibility to enhance this commodity.<br><br>

The idea is to produce a bin for every property in the U.K. Each bin condenses each households waste into renewable energy with the added incentive of money to encourage recycling. Each bin is accompanied by an app, which allows each consumer to keep a record of their “Chute.” This is a privatised scheme not run by the government. Each bin would cost £1,000 with an estimated return within 5 months of purchase. “Chute” the company extracts the fuel and pays ¼ of the profit to the household. <br><br>

The biggest benefit of this product is that instead of valuable gasses escaping into our atmosphere, we will enhance the gas and use it to fuel the society we live in. Chute is for profit, but for the interest of the world.

The purpose of the app is to keep the user up to date with their product. This app would display tips and advice how they can save the environment and make more money. Much like the British Gas app this should become useful to anyone who is money conscious or just interested in saving the environment."

This page was created to help me visualise my research and give a detailed accounts into ten major problems associated with food waste. The page is ten steps to help combat food waste compiled into a webpage. This page indicates books I acquired information to learn about food waste. Included are videos I watched and imagery to accompany each of the steps. The information on this page is included in the apps bellow.

<p>
 Cookie was my answer to helping fight against food waste. 38% of all food is wasted and not eaten after being cooked. This could potentially be that people are cooking too much food or restaurants are throwing away edible products. Not even mentioning the food wasted before prepared which is mentioned within the research part of this page 38% is still a huge amount. This app was connected to the webpage waste above as I used it to see what the problems are, and from that work out how we can fix them. This app combatted the key suggestions, which can help prevent the waste of food. <br><br>

I wanted to link a community aspect within the app, using API systems like on apps like Tinder the app would geographically connect people through food. The gist was like how Tinder works through location to find dates, in a less sawded way Cookie was to arrange dinner parties. For example if I was to post on Cookie; "I am having a dinner party, I have 3 guests already but we can hold up to another 2 people if they would like to join. If they could please bring some wine and potatoes this would be great." Along with this personalised message the user could then write a menu, and even charge potential guests. Each user has a Cookie-Rating, like a star rating to symbolise how good their food is rated. This app was intended to be to the restaurant industry what Uber is to taxis.

<p>
After Cookie came Cookiebook, I did try and come up with a better name and a new logo, however through my process Cookiebook felt natural. It was a play on the phrase “Cooking Book.” At the time I liked the logo and colour scheme a lot. Cookiebook is a different way of combatting food waste: We all have food in our cupboards and fridge which a perishable, we try and use them but sometimes they go to waste. Instead of letting these go to waste, Cookiebook encourages people to use the dregs. For example, I might get home and all I have in the fridge is some broccoli, which is about to go off tomorrow, cream which is running out of date and some fish. I might have no idea how to combine these together to make a delicious meal. Instead of calling a takeaway Cookiebook allows its users to type in these ingredients and suggests recipes, which can turn these scraps into a dish of beauty. This is combatting food waste on a personal level.

To make the web app have content I needed to create a data base, better yet a database which allows each user to add to it. To create this I needed to set up a server using node on terminal. After setting up my server I found a list of recipies on www.jamieoliver.com. Then with this data I needed to imput it into varibles which looks like:<br><br> <br><br>

<br><br> <IMG SRC="./img/screen.jpg" width="80%;"><br><br><br><br> 
<p>
This allows me instead of replicating each icon, the javascript will follow reproduce the pattern of the HTML & Css for each recipie. 
This works for both of these two pages:

<p>
After pitching my idea to both of my tutors both had the same feedback that I should rethink the branding of my app, to something which fits closer to the purpose fo the app. These are the 4 strongest examples I started with:<br><br><br><br>
   <center>

<IMG id="inna" SRC="./img/reb2.jpg" width="50%;"><IMG id="inna" SRC="./img/reb.jpg" width="50%;">
<br><br><br><br><p>
   I looked at words which related to food, saving food and apps. Salvage and Foraged worked well because one is to save something and the other is to find. Open Sauce is a play on the fact the app is Open Source. Food Bank is suggesting the app is like a bank, it saves and holds things of value, in this case recipes and information about food. The shorthand logo of Forage relates to when I lived in Sweden and we would look for mushrooms, herbs, shell fish, fruits and berries on the island. Mushrooms were of an abundance so I thought a toadstool mushroom would make a nice logo, even if it is slightly Super Mario. Salvage was intended to resemble a generic vegetable with a plus sign symbolising such as the red cross or a doctor. Food doctor was another idea which fell through. I had in my mind initially an image of melting vegetables or fruit with bright neon colours. This another reason why Open Sauce & Food Bank were created.

This is what three of the new brands look like using the same HTML5 but changing the logo's and CSS settings to fit each individual colour palletts. While checking these pallets I realised the most scaleable design was the mushroom from Forage. I also felt the colour pallet was the best.

After creating Forage in red a friend of mine mentioned that the colour related to eco friendly things is green, obviously I knew this. I thought I would play around with the colour scheme a bit and I began to think the red was a bit cliché and the green mushroom (Lugi style) is a bit more original. Now the brand colours also represent the message of an eco friendly app.

After changing the logo to green, I now did not know what colours to accompany the icons, green is the stem and leaves of every flower, so so many colours look beautiful with it. These are some samples.<br><br><br><br>

Being indecive I decided to use a colour pulse feature in the css using this code:  <br><br>  body {
        <br>-webkit-animation: colorPulse 10s infinite alternate;}<br>

    <br>@-webkit-keyframes colorPulse {<br>
        0% {background-color: #fff7ad;}<br>
        50% {background-color: #a9efff;}<br>
        100% {background-color: #fbc7ff;}<br>}<br><br>

        This allowed the background colours to alternate like this:<br><br><br><br>   <center>

To improve my app, I felt I should look further at the design. This may consist of redesigning the logo, changing the colour schemes and a potential second name change. I feel forage as a name works well, because the app is about finding recipes using the ingredients you have in your fridge, which you possibly do not know how to combine. like when you forage in the wild the app is about making the most of what you have. When I lived in Sweden I liked on an Island off the coast of Gothenburg called Köpstasö, there was no shops on this island so we would regularly forage for food like; mushrooms, muscles, berries and fruit. Mushrooms were all over the island as there was an abundance of tasty mushrooms to eat. Another reason I validate using mushrooms over other foods you can forage, with mushrooms it is dangerous to eat any random mushroom and takes knowledge to stop yourself from getting ill. After solidifying this decision to use a mushroom as a logo, I decided it would be good to look at mushrooms. Initially I drew some freehand cartoon like mushrooms like this:<br><br>

<img width="30%" id"shrooms123" src="./mushrooms/IMG_2076.jpg">

<img width="45.5%" id"shrooms123" src="./mushrooms/IMG_2080.jpg"><br><br>
<p>
I decided that all these mushroom paintings are too trippy and are associated with magic mushrooms and that I should look at how mushrooms look in the wild so I went foraging and found these mushrooms in the woods:

I took back some of the mushrooms to my flat and layed them out to take a better look of them outside of their enviroment:

I decided to paint a selection of mushrooms that I found and some from the internet:

<br><br><br><br>

To run a server for the app I will need to run it from my Raspberry Pi, which is a tiny computer which dose not take up much electricty as it needs only 5 watts.
I noticed the logo and really liked the geometric style of it. I may use this as influence for the style of my logo.

<p id="new1">After several meetings with my tutors it became apparent to me that I really need to address my colour palettes, fonts, layouts, logos and overall styling. As the deadline is rapidly approaching I decided to take my project back to the drawing board. Compile loads of research. This will consist at looking at existing cook books, contemporary colour pallets and cooking apps.<br><br><br><br>


<p id="new">Noma: Time and Place in Nordic Cuisine:<br><br>
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41o7glmbOUL._SX425_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
<p id="new1"><i>I was suggested to look at this book by one of my lecturers and I found an online pdf @ http://vk.com/doc-35135720_362955430</i><br><br>
 The general consensus of this document is a very cool colour palette with fresh Scandinavian type as seen bellow. This allows the colours in the food to speak for them selves. Each page including the ones with eccentric hues seem to have had the saturation mellowed along with a fabric pattern layered upon it. Some Hex Codes I picked out from the pdf include:<br><br><p id="new1">#eaebef<img src="./img/cd1.jpg"> #e3e5d8<img src="./img/cd2.jpg"> #f8f1f8 <img src="./img/cd3.jpg"><br><br><br><br>

<img width="17%" src="./remix/Noma4.jpg">
<img width="17%" src="./remix/Noma5.jpg">
<br><br> <br><br> <p id="new1">The type seen in the contents bellow shows a consistent fine sans-serif font in all capitals with centred text alignment with the variation of words like "of", "and", "the" in a smaller font size with an addition of lines above them. The soft pink and the mid tone grey make it easy for the reader. The page navigation adding a numerable value is a nice touch and it is an important bit of information all in one.  <br><br> <br><br> 
<center><img width="37%" src="./remix/Noma6.jpg"><br><br> <br><br> 

<p id="new1">Shown bellow are the recipe pages: Each page has a photograph of the dish on the left and instructions on the right. The instructions page has two fonts; A centred sans serif title in a all caps and the main body which looks like Minion Pro with underlined sub titles and a smaller font for ingredients. Every recipe page uses this cool blue with dark grey type. If you look closer you can see that a canvas pattern at a possible 20% opacity has been layered over every page.

<p id="new">Nourished Journal:</p><br><br>
<iframe width="90%" height="900px;" src="https://www.nourishedjournal.com/"></iframe><br><br>
<p id="new1">Nourished is another publication i was suggested to take a look at to help inspire my design. This publication seems to use mild colour palettes similarly to Noma but in a different way. There is a grid format with negative space, which almost frames the imagery. Importantly all text is aligned to the left. This page seems to have a warmer palette and more contrast between white and pastel colours as seen in this image: <br><br>

    <img width="50%" src="https://www.nourishedjournal.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/SetWidthWzE4MjBd-11-Nourished-ED03.jpg"><br><br>

    <p id="new1"> This page layout is interesting to me as the background consists of two obviously different colours, which are both mild enough to compliment each other. I like the thick black line, which frames the text. Two columns makes it easier for the reader two differentiate
 between both paragraphs.

<p id="new1">Similarlly to Noma, Munchies uses a mixture of serif and sans serif fonts to display the difference between titles and body text. The background colours on Munchies are very nutuarl like the last two designs i looked at. However for cirtain headings and links a red has been used.

<p id="new">Chanterelle Mushroom<br><br>
    <p id="new1">The Chantrelle Mushroom is an item of food I used to forage for in Sweden as they are extremely delicious. The colour palette of LemonGrass is based on these mushrooms, this is the pallet I am deciding to go for.<br><br><center>

<p id="new23">Forage</font>
<p id="new1">Even though the branding was done, I still had no logo. Then it dawned on me, the type itself is a logo in its own right. Looking at other apps and brands the title in a specific font can be the logo. Then all I need to do is build an identity around it. Bellow is some examples of logos I considered:<br><br>
<center>
<img width="45%" src="./img/lgl2.png"> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="45%" src="./img/lgl.png"></center>
<br><br>
<p id="new1">The font I am using for "H1 Tags" Or titles is Coolvetica and for body text I am using Minion Pro. I noticed in my research that a bold sans serif font for titles and a nice serif for the body is common practice. So I found two fonts I feel work well and combinded them for the branding of Forage.<br><br>

<p id="new">Identity<center><br><br>
    <p id="new1">Having consistent fonts and colour palettes throughout the app is important to maintain a strong brand identity. However to strengthen this identity throughout the app I have placed mushrooms which initially were going to be logos but now just bring an emotion to the layout. Instead of having clunky mushrooms which sit in the middle of the page. I have had the mushrooms grow out of the app. As in the wild fungus and mushrooms grow.<br><br><center>

<p id="new">Icons<center><br><br>
    <p id="new1">I decided to make more mushrooms to vary the pages a bit.<br><br><center>

<p id="new">Rating System<center><br><br>
    <p id="new1">Initially I was going to put multiple mushrooms (logo) to symbolise the rating of each recipe, like a 5 star rating system. Instead I created a system where each level of cooking ability determined by how other users rate your food. This will save space and will allow me to eventually expand the levels you can get to. Like all "Freemium" Games, the idea is to trigger the users addictive personality by rewarding them with digital prizes. In this case, you can only submit a recipe if you have rated 25 recipes. Once you reach the first level you can then submit 5 recipes, once you submit 5 you go up to the next level. You cannot submit anymore recipes or get to the next level unless you have an average of 70% or over of positive ratings. However you can buy recipe entries for £1.<br><br><center>

<p id="new">Marketing Plan<center><br><br>
    <p id="new1">People who would use Forage inherently like food. To find an audience of people that like food where better to look then restaurants? With the app I will be offering an exclusive deal for Restaurateurs: Instant submission of up to 10 recipes, geographic advertising on the app for their brand for 6 months, if they get a rating over 70% for their recipes they will receive unlimited upload and on the app they will have a certified restaurant mark on their recipes and profiles. They can also place their company logo on their recipie pages. In exchange we will send them a sticker they can place in their window, a discounted price for a new menu design where I will include some information about Forage and the logo. This service not including the menu design will cost £149 (To start with) however this price will go down to £79 if they place the Forage logo in their window. We offer professional photography of food for an additonal £100. <br><br><center>
